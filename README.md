## Getting Started

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed.

```
npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-johnny-five from npm, run:

```
npm install -g generator-johnny-five
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
yo johnny-five
```
